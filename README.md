# Othello
Python implementation of Othello aka [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) 

## How to play

Run the Python script:

```bash
python reversi.py
```

The initial board will be shown and the players will start playing in turns.

Player `⚫️` goes first, let's say it plays a valid move, for example `F4`.

The game will update the board with the player's move.

I will then be the turn of the next player (assuming it can move).
For the actual rulese on how to play this game, visit the Wikipedia site.
